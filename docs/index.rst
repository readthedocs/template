Downtime Detector
==================================================

Welcome to the Officia Documentation for Downtime Detector a small bot that notifies a server through a message when another bot goes offline. 

The main use is to let users know when a bot goes offline and becomes unusable. 

It also lets users know once said bot goes back online. This is useful mostly for server owners with self-hosted bots and need a way of getting notified when they bots go offline.
